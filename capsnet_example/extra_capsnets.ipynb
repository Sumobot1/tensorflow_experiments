Consider the addition X+v where X is a matrix (an array of rank 2) and v is a vector (an array of rank 1). To perform element-wise addition, XLA needs to \"broadcast\" the vector v to the same rank as the matrix X, by replicating v a certain number of times.

Hopefully the code should be self-explanatory, but here are a few details to note:\n",

    "I tried to make the code in this notebook as flat and linear as possible, to make it easier to follow, but of course in practice you would want to wrap the code in nice reusable functions and classes. For example, you could try implementing your own `PrimaryCapsuleLayer`, and `DenseRoutingCapsuleLayer` classes, with parameters for the number of capsules, the number of routing iterations, whether to use a dynamic loop or a static loop, and so on. For an example a modular implementation of Capsule Networks based on TensorFlow, take a look at the [CapsNet-TensorFlow](https://github.com/naturomics/CapsNet-Tensorflow) project.\n",
